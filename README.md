# Dash - Experimenting with features

## Note on running the app.
### If not using the run.ipynb file to run the app the import for dash needs to be changed from JupyterDash to dash.Dash in app.py.

## Note on .py files
### The .py files were created from .ipynb using the extension "Jupytext". Some Jupyter header information is retained in the files.
